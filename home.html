<h2>Rollerblading</h2>
<p>Rollerbladeing is the most fun thing that i do outside. It is what I have been doing for the last 3 years. I can do a lot of things and tricks with it.
  <br>
  Rollerblading is not that popular, but that does not mean others can't be good at it. I am not pro yet, but I can try.
  <br>
  The first time I was rollerblading I couldn't go on two feet, so I went on one foot, and I can still do that! I am not trying to brag about how good I am at Rollerblading, I am just trying to persuade you to rollerblade!

<h2>Youtube</h2>
<p>Youtube is my favorite thing to do. My favorite youtube channel is denisdaily. He is action-packed! So action-packed, I jump around when I see a new video.
  <br>
  This image right here is one of his videos called "Denis Sucks at Minecraft episode 37". It is where denis, in his last video, he killed the wither and in this episode he made the beacon.
  <br>
  Oh, that was my favorite episode of the whole series.
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hyqh25nYs8">Here is his first video on the seires!</a>
<p>Do you think I am done?<br>Sorry, but I got more!!
</p>
<h2>UnspeakableGaming</h2>
<p>UnspeakalbeGaming is my 2nd favorite youtuber. My dad says I should not watch him because he is two crazy.<br> Me and my friend are at war because we argue about how Denis is better than Unspeakable, or Unspeakable is better than Denis.<br> I don't watch Unspeakable anymore, but I still consider him a a youtuber I like.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY3ixlrRf40"> Here is Unspeakable's first video reaction!</a>
<h2>FGTEEV</h2>
<p>
  FGTEEV is my 3rd favorite youtuber.
  <br>
  He plays any game if you suggest it in the comments! So, one video, they were playing "Muddy Hights 2".
  <br>
  I suggest playing that if you like potty humor! It is basically about a guy who just ate and needs to poo.
  <br>
  The door to the downstairs, (where the bathroom is!) the doorhandle broke. So he basically poops of the balcany and and you play as the poop.
  <br>
  You can basically complete challenges and use credits to buy and eat foods that effect how you play. For example, if you get enough credits, you can buy and eat a hamburger.
  <br>
  How that effects your game is it makes you poop greasier. That is one of the games that one FGTEEVer (or FGTEEV fans), suggested.
  <br>
  Another game a FGTEEVer suggested was "Finding Bigfoot". Finding Bigfoot is basically a game that you are on a secret mission. You have a list that states these steps,
  <br>
  1. Find bigfoot.
  <br>
  2. Put him in a cage.
  <br>
  3. Find missing people if possible.
  <br>
  Then you place beartraps, meat, and cameras to have proof that Bigfoot is real.
